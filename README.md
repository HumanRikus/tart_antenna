# TART Antenna

This project is an active antenna design for the TART telescope. This goal of this project is to produce a PCB antenna with integrated Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) for the GPS L1 band (1575.42 MHz) where the TART telescope operates.

Ideally the antenna should have a radiation pattern that is well characterised. This will allow higher dynamic range images to be made. Other design factors can influence the array layout, for example it would be very helpful to have a model for how nearby antennas modify the radiation pattern (coupling between antennas).

## The LNA design

The LNA design uses an NXP GPS LNA chip which has a very good noise performance in the GPS band.
